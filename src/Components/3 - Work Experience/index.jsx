          description="I utilized cookies to bypass the log in process and used Playwright (which is much faster and has better features than Selenium but I have used Selenium as well) for dynamically loaded sites like this one. I also used asynchronous processing which made things faster and and more efficient than my selenium multithreaded version. Also, made it click some stuff for data that can only be accessed after interacting with stuff."

          description="This is a project that utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model. Basically what it does is when encountering a reCaptcha: it tries to get an audio version > get the audio file > use Whisper model to transcribe > return the transcribed audio > input the text > bypass captcha. It has a 95% chance of success even while using just the base model. Google's reCaptcha has static and stuff to make it undetectable but this bypasses said feature."
